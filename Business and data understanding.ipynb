    "<p style='font-size:17px'>John has been living in Seattle for all his life, he was born, raised and even went to university there. After he graduated he met his most significant one, Vanessa, who agreed to be his wife. Two years after their marriage, Nicolas, their first son was born. The family was living the best of life when unfortunately Nicolas was hit by a car at an intersection while riding a bicycle. The injury wasn’t severe enough to threaten his life but a permanent disability will result. Nonetheless, instead of complaining about his fate, he decided to create a foundation which goal is to help cyclists victim from injury by providing emotional support and money to help for the medical expenses. In his last attempt to help that community he hires a data scientist to help prepare a report to be sent to the Town hall about the necessity to guarantee the safety of any people on cycles.</p>\n",
